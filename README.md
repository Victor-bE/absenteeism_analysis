As part of a data analytics project, I had the exciting opportunity to analyze a rich dataset containing valuable information about employees and their reasons for absence from work.
The dataset, collected by the company over several years, includes detailed information about employee demographics, reasons for absence, dates, distance from the workplace, and more. 
Through rigorous analysis, I aimed to uncover the key factors driving employee absences and determine the most common reasons for employee time off. By identifying these patterns, 
I was able to provide valuable insights to the company, which can be used to develop targeted solutions to address absenteeism and improve employee productivity.
This project allowed me to showcase my data analysis skills and provided me with a unique perspective on the challenges 
facing modern businesses.
